2. 21.05.2025 - As reported by the authors of the [$P^3$ dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15379), Pix2Poly achieves state-of-the-art results for multimodal building vectorization from image and LiDAR data sources.

### Abstract:

Extraction of building footprint polygons from remotely sensed data is essential for several urban understanding tasks such as reconstruction, navigation, and mapping. Despite significant progress in the area, extracting accurate polygonal building footprints remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce Pix2Poly, an attention-based end-to-end trainable and differentiable deep neural network capable of directly generating explicit high-quality building footprints in a ring graph format. Pix2Poly employs a generative encoder-decoder transformer to produce a sequence of graph vertex tokens whose connectivity information is learned by an optimal matching network. Compared to previous graph learning methods, ours is a truly end-to-end trainable approach that extracts high-quality building footprints and road networks without requiring complicated, computationally intensive raster loss functions and intricate training pipelines. Upon evaluating Pix2Poly on several complex and challenging datasets, we report that Pix2Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several vector shape quality metrics while being an entirely explicit method.

__Overview of the Pix2Poly architecture:__ The Pix2Poly architecture consists of three major components: (i) The Discrete Sequence Tokenizer, (ii) the Vertex Sequence Detector, (iii) and the Optimal Matching Network. The Discrete Sequence Tokenizer is used to convert the continuous building corner coordinates into discrete building corner coordinate tokens which form the ground truth for training Pix2Poly. The Vertex Sequence Detector is an encoder-decoder transformer that predicts a sequence of sequence of discrete building corner coordinate tokens. The Optimal Matching Network takes the predicted corner coordinate tokens and the per-corner features from the vertex sequence detector and predicts a N X N permutation matrix which contains the connectivity information between every possible corner pair. Together, the predicted building corners and permutation matrix are used to recover the final building polygons.

## Docker Usage

Pix2Poly provides a Docker setup for easy deployment and inference. The Docker container includes a FastAPI server for REST API inference and supports command-line inference.

### Building the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t pix2poly .
```

### Running the API Server

The Docker container automatically starts a FastAPI server on port 8080. You can run it with:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 pix2poly
```

The API server will automatically download the pretrained model files on first startup and provide the following endpoints:

- `POST /invocations` - Main inference endpoint for processing images
- `GET /ping` - Health check endpoint

#### API Usage

The `/invocations` endpoint accepts images in multiple formats:

1. **File Upload (multipart/form-data):**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/invocations" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
     -F "file=@your_image.jpg"
```

2. **Base64 Encoded Image:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/invocations" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"image": "base64_encoded_image_data"}'
```

3. **Raw Image Data:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/invocations" \
     -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \
     --data-binary @your_image.jpg
```

The API returns JSON with the detected polygons:
```json
{
  "polygons": [
    [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...],
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

You can customize the Docker container behavior with these environment variables:

- `EXPERIMENT_PATH`: Path to the experiment folder (default: `runs_share/Pix2Poly_inria_coco_224`)
- `API_KEY`: Optional API key for authentication (if not set, authentication is disabled)

Example with custom configuration:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e EXPERIMENT_PATH=runs_share/Pix2Poly_inria_coco_224 \
  -e API_KEY=your_secret_key \
  pix2poly
```
